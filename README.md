# Basic Java Calculator

 Created a simple calculator in Java using NetBeans with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 The main steps involved in building a calculator in Java with NetBeans and GUI are creating a new project, creating a JFrame form, adding components, setting properties of the components, adding event handlers to the components, defining the functionality of the calculator, and testing the calculator.
